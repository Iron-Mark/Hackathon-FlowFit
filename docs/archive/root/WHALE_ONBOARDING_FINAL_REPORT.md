   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter build apk --release  # or appbundle
   ```

3. **Test on Device**
   ```bash
   flutter run --release
   ```

## 🎨 Design Highlights

### Whale Theme
- **Ocean Blue** (#4ECDC4) primary color
- **Baby whale** companion (customizable)
- **Water sounds** ("splash splash")
- **Marine names** (Bubbles, Splash, Wave, etc.)

### Kid-Friendly UX
- **Large fonts** (20sp+ for inputs)
- **Simple language** (grade 2-4 reading level)
- **Encouraging messages** ("Wow! You take care of me too!")
- **Gamification** (stat gains, level-up, color unlocks)

### COPPA Compliance
- **No PII** (just nickname, optional age)
- **Minimal data** (only wellness goals, no health tracking)
- **Optional permissions** (notifications can be skipped)
- **Parent-friendly** (no purchases, no ads, no social features)

---

## 📝 Known Limitations

1. **No back navigation**: Users can't go back to previous steps (by design, prevents confusion)
2. **No edit after completion**: Once onboarding is done, users must edit in settings (not a blocker)
3. **Single whale species**: Currently only one whale design (could add variety later)
4. **English only**: No i18n yet (could add translations later)

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Post-Launch)

- **Animated whale swim**: Add swimming animation in step 3
- **Sound effects**: "Splash" sound when whale appears
- **Multiple whale types**: Blue whale, orca, beluga, narwhal
- **Onboarding skip**: For returning users or testing
- **Whale customization**: Accessories, patterns, eyes
- **Goal tracking**: Show progress on selected goals in dashboard
